# MetabWorkflowTutorial-v1.0.0 is a copy of Metabolomics Workbench Project comprised of Tutorials 1,2 and 3

# Tutorial 1
The first is a Jupyter notebook describing a typical metabolomics data analysis workflow for a study with a binary classification outcome. The main steps included are: Excel data sheet import, Pooled QC-based data cleaning, Principal Component Analysis reduction and some univariate and multivariate statistics.
The study used in this tutorial has been previously published as an open access article Chan et al. (2016), in the British Journal of Cancer, and the deconvolved and annotated data file deposited at the Metabolomics Workbench data repository (Project ID PR000699). The data can be accessed directly via its project DOI:10.21228/M8B10B.

# Tutorial 2 - Interactive Metabolomics Data Analysis Workflow
The functionality of this notebook is identical to Tutorial 1, but now the text cells have been expanded into a comprehensive interactive tutorial. As before, text cells provide the metabolomics context and describe the purpose of the code in the following code cell; however, this has now been simplified to avoid complete reptition of Tutorial 1. Additional coloured text boxes are now placed throughout the workflow to help novice users navigate and understand the interactive principles of a Jupyter Notebook.
